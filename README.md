# phyloDB
PhyloDB is a project that provides a framework for large scale phylogenetic analysis in the form of a Web API application, a graph oriented database ([Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/)), and a plugin for the database. The aim of this project is to allow the representation of large phylogenetic networks and trees, as well as ancillary data, support queries on such data, and the deployment of algorithms for inferring/detecting patterns and for computing visualizations. It was developed in the scope of a master thesis for IST (Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico).

The [wiki](https://github.com/Brunovski/phyloDB/wiki) of this project provides documentation of several topics, namely archictecural views, deployment, authentication and the api definition (usage).
